UsageStat is a desktop/laptop utility that records uptime/downtime for a configurable number of systems on a per-user basis. Statistics are automatically encrypted and uploaded to configurable cloud storage solution. Data backup is handled at user-configurable time intervals, with error handling and localized correction. Encryption is handled by RSA and openSSL generated security keys, which are automatically excluded from any accidental upload to cloud storage. Language localization is available at a user-configurable basis.
